        <p> In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. A force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.

            The original form of Newton's second law states that the net force acting upon an object is equal to the rate at which its momentum changes with time. If the mass of the object is constant, this law implies that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
            
            Concepts related to force include: thrust, which increases the velocity of an object; drag, which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque, which produces changes in rotational speed of an object. In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress. Such internal mechanical stresses cause no acceleration of that body as the forces balance one another. Pressure, the distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body, is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate. Stress usually causes deformation of solid materials, or flow in fluids </p>

        <p> First law
            Main article: Newton's first law
            Newton's First Law of Motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force (resultant force).[9] This law is an extension of Galileo's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force (see a more detailed description of this below). Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium "natural state" in place of the Aristotelian idea of the "natural state of rest". That is, Newton's empirical First Law contradicts the intuitive Aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity. By making rest physically indistinguishable from non-zero constant velocity, Newton's First Law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities. Specifically, in systems where objects are moving with different velocities, it is impossible to determine which object is "in motion" and which object is "at rest". The laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference, that is, in all frames related by a Galilean transformation.
            
            For instance, while traveling in a moving vehicle at a constant velocity, the laws of physics do not change as a result of its motion. If a person riding within the vehicle throws a ball straight up, that person will observe it rise vertically and fall vertically and not have to apply a force in the direction the vehicle is moving. Another person, observing the moving vehicle pass by, would observe the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down. From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction of the vehicle. Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable. Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest. </p>

        <p> Second law
            Main article: Newton's second law
            A modern statement of Newton's Second Law is a vector equation:[Note 1]
            
            {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}},}{\vec {F}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}},
            where {\displaystyle {\vec {p}}} \vec{p} is the momentum of the system, and {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}}{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}} is the net (vector sum) force. If a body is in equilibrium, there is zero net force by definition (balanced forces may be present nevertheless). In contrast, the second law states that if there is an unbalanced force acting on an object it will result in the object's momentum changing over time.[9]
            
            By the definition of momentum,
            
            {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} \left(m{\vec {v}}\right)}{\mathrm {d} t}},}{\vec {F}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} \left(m{\vec {v}}\right)}{\mathrm {d} t}},
            where m is the mass and {\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}} is the velocity.[3]:9–1, 9–2
            
            If Newton's second law is applied to a system of constant mass,[Note 2] m may be moved outside the derivative operator. The equation then becomes
            
            {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=m{\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {v}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}.}{\vec {F}}=m{\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {v}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}.
            By substituting the definition of acceleration, the algebraic version of Newton's Second Law is derived:
            
            {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=m{\vec {a}}.}{\vec {F}}=m{\vec {a}}.
            Newton never explicitly stated the formula in the reduced form above.[10]
            
            Newton's Second Law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements. However, while kinematics are well-described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain as to what is the proper definition of mass. General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales. With some justification, Newton's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.
            
            The use of Newton's Second Law as a definition of force has been disparaged in some of the more rigorous textbooks,[3]:12–1[4]:59[11] because it is essentially a mathematical truism. Notable physicists, philosophers and mathematicians who have sought a more explicit definition of the concept of force include Ernst Mach and Walter Noll.[12][13]
            
            Newton's Second Law can be used to measure the strength of forces. For instance, knowledge of the masses of planets along with the accelerations of their orbits allows scientists to calculate the gravitational forces on planets. </p>

        <p> Third law
            Main article: Newton's third law
            Whenever one body exerts a force on another, the latter simultaneously exerts an equal and opposite force on the first. In vector form, if {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {F}}_{1,2}}{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {F}}_{1,2}} is the force of body 1 on body 2 and {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {F}}_{2,1}}{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {F}}_{2,1}} that of body 2 on body 1, then
            
            {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}_{1,2}=-{\vec {F}}_{2,1}.}{\vec {F}}_{1,2}=-{\vec {F}}_{2,1}.
            This law is sometimes referred to as the action-reaction law, with {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {F}}_{1,2}}{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {F}}_{1,2}} called the action and {\displaystyle \scriptstyle -{\vec {F}}_{2,1}}{\displaystyle \scriptstyle -{\vec {F}}_{2,1}} the reaction.
            
            Newton's Third Law is a result of applying symmetry to situations where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects. The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies,[14][Note 3] and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body.
            
            In a system composed of object 1 and object 2, the net force on the system due to their mutual interactions is zero:
            
            {\displaystyle {\vec {F}}_{1,2}+{\vec {F}}_{\mathrm {2,1} }=0.}{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}_{1,2}+{\vec {F}}_{\mathrm {2,1} }=0.}
            More generally, in a closed system of particles, all internal forces are balanced. The particles may accelerate with respect to each other but the center of mass of the system will not accelerate. If an external force acts on the system, it will make the center of mass accelerate in proportion to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.[3]:19–1[4]
            
            Combining Newton's Second and Third Laws, it is possible to show that the linear momentum of a system is conserved.[15] In a system of two particles, if {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {p}}_{1}}{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {p}}_{1}} is the momentum of object 1 and {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {p}}_{2}}{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {p}}_{2}} the momentum of object 2, then
            
            {\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}_{1}}{\mathrm {d} t}}+{\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}_{2}}{\mathrm {d} t}}={\vec {F}}_{1,2}+{\vec {F}}_{2,1}=0.}{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}_{1}}{\mathrm {d} t}}+{\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}_{2}}{\mathrm {d} t}}={\vec {F}}_{1,2}+{\vec {F}}_{2,1}=0.}
            Using similar arguments, this can be generalized to a system with an arbitrary number of particles. In general, as long as all forces are due to the interaction of objects with mass, it is possible to define a system such that net momentum is never lost nor gained.[3][4] </p>
